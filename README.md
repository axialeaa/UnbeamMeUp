**Unbeam Me Up** is a simple client-side [Fabric][fabric] mod made for **Quacon SMP** that removes the light show emitted by ender dragons during their death sequence. This significantly reduces FPS/client lag with death-suppressed dragon experience farms.
***

### Getting Started
- Make sure you're running a Fabric instance of the game. If you're playing from the vanilla launcher, follow the [Fabric installation guide][fabric-guide]. If you're playing from a third-party launcher like [Prism][prism], you'll need to follow their own instructions which you can often find on their respective websites. For example, [here][prism-guide] is Prism's guide to downloading mods.
- Download the latest version of **Unbeam Me Up** for your game version from the [GitHub releases][github-releases] page. Drag the `.jar` file into your mods folder and launch the game!
